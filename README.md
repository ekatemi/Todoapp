# Todo list

Final project in Ironhack Front End bootcamp 2022

## Brief

This app is a simple todo list, user log in with e-mail and password and add, delete and edit items in his personal Todo List.

## Tech Stack

- Client: Vue.js, Vite (dev server)
- Router: Vue Router
- Store: Pinia, Pinia persist
- Database: Supabase (Database as a service)
- Bootstrap + custom CSS for styling

## Functionality

- Authentication (sign up, sign in, sign out)
- A front-end that displays the userâ€™s personal to-do list
- User can add new tasks
- User can edit existing tasks
- User can mark tasks as complete/incomplete
- User can delete existing tasks

It was all big challenge for me, first time creating an app by myself, interacting with database, facing all kind of errors. Initially my idea was to create the list of films, connecting the app with some api to get description and images. Hope to implement that feature soon.
